/**
 * Abstract base class for all MultiFileAnalyses. A MultiFileAnalysis calculates a set of metrics on
 * not just a single JAR file, but a set of JAR files contained in a single directory. This is done
 * by calculating custom intermediate results (of type T) for each JAR individually, before aggregating
 * those intermediate results into one or more metric values.
 *
 * @param directory Directory containing all JAR files that are being analyzed
 * @param customOptions Custom analysis options taken from the CLI. Can be used to modify behavior
 *                      of the analysis via command-line
 * @tparam T Type of the intermediate results produced for each JAR file in the folder
